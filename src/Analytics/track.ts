/**
 * A typed page view decorator for the top level component for your screen. This is the
 * function you must use at the root of your component tree, otherwise your track calls

 *
 * For the majority of Emission code, this should only be used inside the AppRegistry,
 * however if you have other components which are going to be presented using a navigation
 * controller then you'll need to use this.
 *
 * The main implementation difference between this and `track` is that this hooks the callbacks
 * to our native `Events.postEvent` function.
 *

 *
 * @example
 *
 *      ```ts
 *      import { screenTrack, Schema } from "lib/utils/track"
 *
 *       @screenTrack({
 *        context_screen: Schema.PageNames.ConsignmentsWelcome,

 *

/**
 * ## Writing tests for your tracked code
 *
 * By default we mock `react-tracking`, so it's not possible to test the code easily.
 *
 * A good pattern for testing analytics code is to have a completely separate file
 * for the tests. For example: `__tests__/Overview-analytics-tests.tsx`. Jest has each
 * test file run in a unique environment, so in that file we can unmock react-tracking.
 *
 * Here's a full example:
 *
 * @example
 *
 *       ```ts
 *      import { shallow } from "enzyme"
 *      import Event from "lib/NativeModules/Events"
 *      import React from "react"
 *
 *      // Unmock react-tracking so that it will wrap our code
 *      jest.unmock("react-tracking")
 *      import Overview from "../Overview"
 *
 *      // Create a stub for checking the events sent to the native code
 *      // and make it reset between tests
 *      jest.mock("lib/NativeModules/Events", () => ({ postEvent: jest.fn() }))
 *      beforeEach(jest.resetAllMocks)
 *
 *      it("calls the draft created event", () => {
 *
 *        // Use enzyme to render the component tree
 *        // note that we need to `dive` into the first child component
 *        // so that we get to the real component not the reac-tracking HOC
 *        const overviewComponent = shallow(<Overview [...] />).dive()
 *        const overview = overviewComponent.instance()
 *
 *        // Run the function which triggers the tracking call
 *        overview.submissionDraftCreated()
 *
 *        // Check that the native event for the analytics call is sent
 *        expect(Event.postEvent).toBeCalledWith({
 *          action_name: "consignmentDraftCreated",
 *          action_type: "success",
 *          context_screen: "ConsignmentsOverview",
 *          context_screen_owner_type: "ConsignmentSubmission",
 *          owner_id: "123",
 *          owner_slug: "123",
